Annotate the class to be a Room database. Declare the entities that belong in the databaseâ€”
in this case there is only one entity, Word.
 (Listing the entities class or classes creates corresponding tables in the database.)
 Set the version number.
 Also set export schema to false, exportSchema keeps a history of schema versions.
 For this practical you can disable it, since you are not migrating the database.
